## Project Description
This project uses JavaScript and Node.js to create an application that generates a professional README file based on the user's input. The code consists of an index.js file where the inquirer app is called to prompt all the questions that is required for the README file, a readme-template file that holds the template for the README file and a generateMarkdown file that calls the badges for the different license options. The app is initialized with Node.js executing the index file. This file runs the code in a series of functions and promises which concludes writing a README file based on the user's responses.
